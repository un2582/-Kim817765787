DESCRIPTION: Website created using .NET that showcases CRUD functionality. Meant to be used for storing online novels

NOTE:
PLEASE RUN THE PROJECT LOCALLY AS THE HASHTABLE USED TO STORE DATA ON AZURE SERVERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE USED TO STORE IT LOCALLY THEREFORE THE AZURE SERVERS GIVES WRONG ACCOUNT DATA AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LOG IN WITH THE ACCOUNT CREATED IN THE PROJECT

How to run:
Unzip the files onto a proper IDE and simply run the project. You will be prompted to a login page. This project is meant to use .NET in order to create a website with CRUD capabilities. In my case I created a simple website that is meant to mimic a library or cache for online novels/books. The admin has all four CRUD functionalities while simple users will be subject to simply having read functionality. Note that I implemented the functionalites as per required of this project, I did not implement a full on cache of actual online novels.

This was done as a project for my CompE360 class
