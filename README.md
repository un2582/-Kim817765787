This is the github for my CompE561 Final Assignment.
Please do note that a large chunk of my code is from documents found online
I am not plagiarizing, but there was simply too many lines of code from
all different sorts of sources for me to go over and mark each one with a comment
saying that it's not from me.
P.S I barely used GitHub since I was working alone. I do have prior experience using github however, for
a personal project I did with friends for making games.
